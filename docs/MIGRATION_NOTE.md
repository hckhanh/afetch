# Documentation Migration Note

The documentation in this folder is still based on the fast-url template. 
This needs to be updated to reflect the afetch library instead.

## What needs to be done:

1. Update `docs/content/docs/index.mdx` - Replace fast-url introduction with afetch
2. Update `docs/content/docs/getting-started.mdx` - Replace fast-url examples with afetch
3. Update `docs/content/docs/api-reference.mdx` - Document afetch API
4. Update `docs/package.json` - Change project name and dependencies
5. Remove SVG files for fast-url in `docs/public/`

This is a separate task that should be tracked as a documentation issue.
